# AI Agent vs Traditional Chatbot

This project demonstrates the difference between a traditional rule-based chatbot and an AI-based conversational agent using OpenAI's GPT model.

## 1. Traditional Chatbot

The traditional chatbot is rule-based and can respond only to predefined inputs. It cannot handle dynamic conversations or complex user queries.

### Run the Traditional Chatbot

```bash
python traditional_chatbot.py
